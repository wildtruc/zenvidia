## Important change log notes
v2.1.15 NOTES :
 - BUG: Zenity continue to do weird thing, it appears it wont display long text in 'text-info' option and close some nvidia help chapters unexpectedly. No clue.

v2.1.11 NOTES :
 - The new version of zenity (v3.92.0) bring display issues that gtk theme look to not support. window's height and width have been updated to reflect previous and new version. User will probably need to modify fonts colors.
 - Because this is a fast fix, it may be possible that not all height and width have been updated.

v2.0.15 NOTES :
 - Drivers serie from and below 390 have some issue on loading because dev is not created. working in progress.
 - xterm compilation window has be moved to Yad log window.

v2.0.14 NOTES :
 - Add warning and auto drivers setting for Optimus in case of multi and non Nvidia devices detection. Default Basic conf has been change accordingly and zenvidia local config need to be update.

 **Remind you that a Optimus manager is required for prime, offload, etc.**

 To change local zenvidia config manually, add the lines below in `.zenvida/basic.conf` :
 ```
# Optimus modules preset setting : (1) or not (0)
opti_preset=0
# don't display Optimus modules setting messsage: (1) or not (0)
no_opti_warn=0
 ```

v2.0.12 NOTES :
 - When installing driver for old devices not supported by actual driver serie, in case of Optimus/Prime nothing is managed to warn or prepare for this type of device system; so be aware that it could break your xorg config if you install drivers for Optimus/Prime. Diging for a soft solution (my old laptop would be delighted).
 - It look like that the default font used in Zenvidia is not install by default in all distro (Google-Noto-Sans) and because of this, zenity doesn't display correctly tab and so on. Further research is need to fix this.

v2.0.9 zen_notif hopefully fixed with others anoying things (from 2023-01-18 Issue).

v2.0.8 introduced the option `exec_mod_tool` in basic config allowing when set to `0` to use initramfs tool for all install/upgrade/update processes. Set to `1`, only install/upgrade use it, other use modprobe relaod method. Default is :
```
# Use modules reload instead of initramfs tool (exec_mod_tool) : (1) or not (0)
exec_mod_tool=1
```


v2.0.5 unset DKMS `autoinstall all` to allow only the loaded driver (open or closed source) to be compile at kernel upgrade boot time. If you have some extra drivers to be also compiled at kernel upgrade, add in driver's DKMS config file `AUTOINSTALL=yes` (do not add AUTOINSTALL=no, it doesn't work and breaks dkms conf).


v2.0.5 FIX : Driver version 525.78.01 give error at nvidia-drm driver load with nvidia.drm-modeset=1 that starting plymouth splash screen. Option `drm_modset` has been introduced in basic config file to set/unset nvidia.drm-modeset in grub command line and could be manualy modified (.zenvidia/basic.conf). Default is :
```
# Activate plymouth splash screen (nvidia-drm.modeset) : (1) or not (0)
drm_modset=0
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Known issues
Driver version 525.78.01 give error at nvidia-drm driver load with nvidia.drm-modeset=1 (fix in v2.0.5).

Script doesn't provide Nvidia driver uninstall process. May be later, after a long long rest.

I once meet a dkms issue on dkms install that didn't install ... nothing. State "unknown". It was hopfully fixed in v2.0.5.
If you meet this, quick solution is to use **Update driver only (dkms)** in **Update drivers and modules**.

Other method is to restart the PC and use in console TTY mode the rescue command line `zenvida rebuild [driver version]` after disabled in grub starting menu the value `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` to `0`.

See Changelog.txt for other changes and discovered issues.

This will install in default behaviour.

Choose a directory to clone repo and :

  cd zenvidia/
```
As superuser :
```sh
  # then :
  # to install to default :
  make install
  # to remove all :
  make uninstall
  # to remove safely (doesn't remove downloaded driver packages)
  make safeuninstall
  # to update :
  make update
```
And :
Through terminal command line for GUI.
```sh
	zen_start # (with administrator priviledge)
	zenvidia  # (with no priviledge)
```
or with desktop file from end user inface menu > settings > others menu.
```sh
	zenvidia (admin) # (with administrator priviledge)
	zenvidia (user)  # (with no priviledge)
```
Or by the desktop menu entry in Setting menu.
The GUI will ask you for admin/superuser password.

### Zen Notify
Zenvidia notify is taskbar notifier checking at user session boot time for driver updates.
It is installed at the same time as Zenvidia when launching `make install` command.

It comes with 2 options:
 - -z > check zenvidia script and nvidia drivers.
 - -n > check nvidia drivers only.

Default desktop entry file is set to ```-n```, you can manage options through **main menu > Configuration and Tools menu**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Usage
### GUI
In terminal :
 - ```zen_start``` (with administrator priviledge)
 - ```zenvidia``` (with no priviledge)

From desktop :

With **end user interface menu > settings > others menu**.

### Command line
Desktop manager have to be shutdown with `systemcl disable [desktop-manager]` command (it doesn't really care in case of real rescue, DM is crashed anyway).

Note : the Grub starting menu option `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` activate the plymouth splash screen and prevent switching to TTY console with Ctrl+Alt+F(x). If set, it is mandatory to change this option to `0` and have a good access to TTY. In case of a real crash, it doesn't really care, but be aware that you will get acces to **one** TTY only.

```zenvidia [command] [version]```

command are : _restore, rebuild, rescue, reinit_.

version is the desired driver version _(displayed with zenvidia command alone with X server off)_.

## History
I started Zenvidia several years ago in a background of non existent Nvidia drivers managed by distros. I builded it with a light knowledge of bash code I was learning on the scratch and with the only goal of my own use.
I finally brought it to the community, with all my knowledge gaps, and maintained it for a couples of years until my health prevent me to go on.
I throw the sponge, hoping someone somewhere one day will continue or make a new one.

Despite my personal condition I went by time back in the code to add, change some little things because I was still using it, and despite the fact that my distro was delivering Nvidia drivers, Zenvidia was still more flexible.

Then, the 515 drivers series went out with the open source drivers. Yeah, it was cool, but as always Nvidia's old school linux drivers developpers put brut terminal only tools (I still love you guys! :yum: ), event not a possibility to test and switch back.
And as always, I decided to put that in Zenvidia.
Going back to Zenvidia bash code after a so long suspend was not a peace of cake and take me at least 2 month to understand the clean way to make a fast switch and even wash the code of all the useless things.

Now it's done and tested in almost all weirdest way ( I do very strange things some time) and there is still some [issues](#Known Issues).
The code wont be maintain, just because of me, I just hope people will enjoy using it, because I don't think there's any equals in the whole linux community.

Note that the script even if it does less than before is doing more.
