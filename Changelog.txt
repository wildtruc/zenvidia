* 2022-12-26 - v2.0.1
  - In the particular circonstance of a fresh kernel update (happens to me today), only the defined module type is automaticaly compiled at boot time by DKMS daemon (open or prop). This situation wasn't expected by open driver switch tool. Now the tool have acces to recompile section for this particlar case.
  - Distro config section at start didn't take care of sudo unknown type over a known or unknown distro. now the sudo type is ask and saved in the main script conf if not in default known distro list.
  - Add a display manager restart/reenable function when in rescue terminal mode only (bored to type it each time when testing).  Function also reload drivers allowing to emmediatly start the DM. DM is evaluate on systemctl status. If it doesn't work for you, post a thread in discussion with the result of systemctl status [your-dm].
  - Fix a few nutshells in README.md HELP.txt and other. I will probably find more in future.
* 2023-01-03 - v2.0.2
 - Found that "Update driver for an other kernel" was still using old vars and wasn't install driver in the disered kernel path. This is fixed.
 - Found that Display Manager detection was useless if DM service was manually disable. Reworked with a 'known' dm service list (gdm,kdm,xdm,lightdm,lxdm,slim,sddm) then fall back to previous method if not found. If you have a better idea for fallback, be welcome.
 - grub command find method was wrong, fixed.
 - Encapsuled code for xterm process was faulty in many ways. Remove, add/remove wasn't work properly in some condition. This patch try a new process.
 - Dkms has issues when a kernel host a driver he didn't manage and just not remove it even asked for. It happens some times too when updating a driver for an other kernel. This patch is trying to fix this.
 - initramfs is not usefull in all circonstances. This is long and boring process to just fixing open/prop value at kernel boot.
 The issue is that not all install dkms process take over a simple modprobe relaod and initrmafs update is still necessary.
 For this patch, "Update driver for an other kernel" is using it , other install function use modprpobe and systemd-modules-reload service with a fallback to initrmafs update tool if systemed tool is not found.
 - removed driver backup in nvidia's directory. It became useless.
 - reordered shared_var process that only belonged to old script's system.
 - zen_notify was displaying a use le blank line. This is fix (hopefuly).
 - add a reinit command to command line rescue process that only taking care of initramfs and DM service restore.
 - exec_mod_load take care of the installed divice when doing modprobe, could be changed to "all" if reporing issues.
 - nv_cmd_make_src need probably to be reviewed.
 - Else : I need a rest v_v ...
* 2023-01-04 - v2.0.3
 - modprobe modules reload was experimented in last 'push' v2.0.2 for driver upgrade. It definively doesn't work. Initramfs update is now used only until find out a better solution. In case you this issue, just exec 'zenvidia reinit [driver_version]' when locked in terminal at boot.
 - basic conf has been reorder to diplay important sets first and make it more readable.
 - fixed little mistakes.
 - issue : need to get pid when in VT mode and kill it at DM service start because the console is still active and zenvidia doesn't report the right user (root instead of default user).
* 2023-01-05 - v2.0.4
 - Forgot to update 'open driver switch' to new 'version' detection function. Fixed ( Yeah, not my best swing...)
 - Found a way to kill extra root tty when starting from console. Now the pid is auto killed after DM start.
 - Trying to find a way to prevent wrong driver to be compiled at boot time (case mutli versions present in DKMS /var/lib). DKMS seems to like the higher version even if a lower is installed.
* 2023-01-08 - v2.0.5 (with 525.78.01 fix)
 - INCLUDE FAST FIX: Driver version 525.78.01 give error at nvidia-drm driver load with nvidia.drm-modeset=1. This patch look in basic conf for a custom setting of nvidia.drm-modeset to overwrite automation. Read README to how add the custom line in basic file. Or remove local basic conf to get shipped default.
 This was made in emergency, some issues could appears because of the changes below.
 - After research and tests, it appears adding the dedicted DKMS blank file 'no-autoinstall' in /etc/dkms allow to build only the authorized dkms.conf file with 'AUTOINSTALL=yes' to be compile at boot time. This is now how zenvidia works.
 However, the distro package updater (fedora dnf in my case) seems needing the DKMS option 'autoinstall -all' to be set at kernel update, and thus, package install scripts don't compile the driver. This is absolutly not fatal, juste anoying.
 Note that if you have other drivers to be compile at boot time, you need to add in their dkms.conf file the option 'AUTOINSTALL=yes'; if you don't, they just wont compile at a new kernel update.
 - Looking for a way to use initramfs divert tools without put it in distro configuration files. Known tools are : dracut, update-initramfs, mkinitcpio. Script now look up to this tools in the describe order then autoconfig it internaly to exec initramfs reload. If none is found, it ask to proceed with modprobe reload only with a warn about consequencies or abort.
 Because of the fast fix, distro's config files are not update yet.
 - Devs have change something in version changelog text I didn't look into yet that prevent last changes to be read correctly.
* 2023-01-12 - v2.0.6
 - Changelog text file reading is fix (found some mistakes by the way). Hoping my dear lovely trolls wont change something else at next version :).
 - Fixed base menu display that suddently change for an absolutly unknown reason O_o. If you meet Zenity display issues, please tell it in Discussion section.
 - Zen Notify git repos part wasn't report and display correcty needed messages. It's hopefuly fixed. Complete change log can be found in default user zenvidia's directory (.zenvidia/src/zen_git.log).
 - A few moves in script syntax. I keep going deeper into the code until my thought tell me that everything is stable enought.
* 2023-01-15 - v2.0.7
 - zen_notify option command '-z' (driver and zenvidia update notification) wasn't report and fill changelog and notfication correctly (wrong comparative date check). This is fixed ... probably.
 - uploaded admended distro config files.
* 2023-01-17 - v2.0.8
 - add a Zenvidia changes log reader. Useless, therefore obviously a mandatory feature.
 - Trying to find a way to not use initramfs_tools and was partly successful. All update modules tools works fine without rebuilding initramfs, but install and upgrade section still need it. Add an option in basic config file to set/unset use of initramfs that could be usefull in futur and present if user want to use initramfs only for all purpose or issue. Still diging.
 - Changed for a lighter method to discover needed system commands (dkms, lspci, etc).
 - Little review of dep_control function to diplay missing dependencies list instead of just warn.
* 2023-01-21 - v2.0.9
 - Went to last update to fast and didn't test zen_notify enought. I'm not a great git syntax user and it appears that using 'git fetch' on the downloaded zenvidia git repo wasn't a good idea. I wished to add last updated files in zenvidia log, but it's now certain that it couldn't be done with git only. So, only change log is now added (this change log), and put an issue alert if new mistake and so on, pops up... again.
 - Globally, my apologies. Yes, this is not the last...
 - Archive restore DKMS section was wrong and give wrong version number that removed ... the restored nvidia dir at the end u_u. Plus, when DKMS process engage for modules build, old version were wrongly define, then dkms wont installed nothing because the restored version were lower than the already present one. This a dkms limitation. Fixed.
 - For the same reasons, commandline tools has been admended to work in the same way.
 - Add a check sum control and fix a size diff between remote and local downloaded drivers packages, that... didn't diff nothing (old zenvidia bad legacy). Script now control if check sum is possible, but check also if size between downloaded and remote differ in case of download error.
 - initrmafs process is now applied on a mandatory for install/upgrade drivers and for archives restore if dkms is use to build inexistent modules. No alternative found at this moment.
 - There's still some little things I wish to change.
 - I hope this the very last of my mistakes this time v_v. Should I apply for a job at M$ ?
* 2023-01-22 - v2.0.10
 - zen_notify issue with '-z' option (again v_v), previous patch was mistaken. Fixed.
 - read zenvidia changelog was read from zenvidia local dir, this is rubbish. Read now from Changelog.txt.
 - Makefile change accordingly.
* 2023-01-27 - v2.0.11
 - restore backup previous package detection mistake. A variable was misplaced in processus that prevent previous version dir to be removed (not fatal, anoying).
 - restore backup tool was using modprobe reload that seemed to work, but, not really. Fallback to initramfs_tools until figure out something more sure. Use command line reinit tool in case of troubles.
 - Re arranged update section window and behaviour.
 - Secondary driver was always compiling even if already builded. Add a filter to detect if driver is already in DKMS path before building anything.
* 2023-02-07 - v2.0.12
 - It appears that tue 'who' command to identify desktop user doesn't report anything in some end user interfece (lxde in my case, I didn't know that). Added a fallback in zenvidia and reverse to old way in makefile (a bit archaïc, but working).
 - Found also a mistake in auto distro config checker. Fixed.
 - Add a check driver family serie in pre install/download section to inform wich serie is compatible when older driver are select. If found, last driver of this serie is proposed in the install/download list.
 - Revamp older driver serie download section that was still in old zenvidia version mode.
 - Many mandatory little changes also in consequencies of the rework above.
 - Zen Notify wasn't checking date if local zenvidia changelog file was already wrote. Fixed.
 - Simplifyied PCI_ID
 - Because of number of test show cases of all this change, this is very expérimeantal and there still tests to do. Issue report would be very welcome.
 - NOTE : When installing driver for old devices not supported by actual driver serie, in case of Optimus/Prime nothing is managed to warn or prepare for this type of device system; so be aware that it could break your xorg config if you install drivers for Optimus/Prime. Diging for a soft solution (my old laptop would be delighted).
 - NOTE : It look like that the default font used in Zenvidia is not install by default in all distro (Google-Noto-Sans) and because of this, zenity doesn't display correctly tab and so on. Further research is need to fix this.
* 2023-02-07 - v2.0.13
 - Missing loop in hardware_compat in case on multi GPU devices detection.
* 2023-02-11 - v2.0.14
 - Add warning and auto drivers setting for Optimus in case of multi and non Nvidia devices detection. (xorg part still todo, maybe). Default Basic conf has been change accordingly and zenvidia local conf need to be update (seed README.md for manually update details).
 - Fixed daily zenvidia internal zen_notify check file owner that prevent zen_notif itself to update the daily check file (case no file found at first start).
 - Remove a useless zen_notify autostart desktop entry checker.
 - Rework check update from net part to be better displayed and get the possibility to download/install the best driver for old hardware if found.
* 2023-02-26 - v2.0.15
 - Add xdpyinfo to initial install list (need by xorg configurator to get DPI depht).
 - Missing a space in initial grub config regex. Fixed.
 - Fixed a mistaken typo in dkms conf lower than 515 serie.
 - Fixed a check for older installed version in dkms compilation that was buggy on first fresh install.
 - Compilation error message display wasn't working as expected. Hopefuly fixed.
 - Compiling directly from source wasn't updated for too long and missing many vars from other previous fix. Add a signing modules too. Openssl added to package list installer.
 - Change xterm compilation/installation window to 'yad' log view window. This way is more clear and flexible for coding and fix.
 - NOTE : Compiling and installing older drivers like 390 serie and below is more messy than expected. There more work to do. At this state they do install, but system wont load them correctly (optimus case). Plus, dkms didn't find MOK signing key in the first place and just remove compiled modules at the end of the process; dkms script is really not made for what we are asking it to do. It finally works by adding a pre check function for mok files and creation if not found; it's also used now for source direct compilation. I sadly think this not the end of the tunnel.
* 2023-03-17 - v2.0.16
 - Update driver result wasn't properly diplayed (reversing official, beta) and end question was misplaced in chain resulting in the wrong window installation model. Fixed, but some filter still need to be tested and checked, especially for old driver versions.
 - Error in grub conf upodate regex preventing code to update the conf. Fixed.
 - Archive restoration was removing nvidia libs directory when restoring in fresh distro install process because the driver restored was the same as previuosly installed in /usr/local partition. Fixed.
 - Yad was replacing all depencies installation, that was a mistake. Xterm is now automaticaly installed if missing and used for basic fresh install process; Yad is still use for futur depencies addition. All starting process has been re-ordered to fit this correctly.
 - Note : Still working arround old driver and PRIME process. There is some progresses, but it appears that PRIME displaying context differ with Desktop Environment (grrr).
 - APOLOGIES : My condition slow down severly the work to do and makes me doing stupide mistakes. I am very sorry about that.
* 2023-03-31 - v2.0.17
 - As expected, install check UI was not enought set properly. This not glorious, but probably fixed now. (I hate my condition)
 - dkms repos cleaning wasn't remove previous driver dir because install process already removed the current driver, and thus dkms said that the driver was already removed (sic). Add a hard remove at the end of the post install processes.
 - Few others fixes (check git diff).
* 2023-05-15 - v2.1.5
 - Add a rescan of the pci bus in case dGPU power switch off (ex: nvidia-xrun) during pci bus detection.
 - Add a special alternative xorg config for iGPU/dGPU case. PAY ATTENTION: this feature actualy only prepare the xorg file for prime, nvidia-xrun and others offload cases, manually edit or dedicated optimus manager is still needed to really switch to dGPU support. iGPU is set as default.
 - Add an udev rule for 430 serie and older. In old series driver, kernel wasn't creating device system linking correctly. This workaround try to fix this (not garanted. nvidia-xrun could meet some issues and removed udev rule may be needed).
 - Add a remove nvidia driver function that completly remove nvidia's installation.
 - Add Xorg auto config tool to Xorg management menu.
 - Fix a non updated variable from old zenvidia version in grub postinstall config, nvidia-drm option set has been migrate to modprobe option to Simplify drm set option edit.
 - Note : It appears also that nvidia-xrun xinitrc work for old nvida-prime-select switch system for old driver series. Working on it.
 - Few other minor fixes.
* 2023-06-21 - v2.1.7
 - Difference between official and beta driver was wrongly interpreted in both zenvdia and zen_notif. Fixed.
* 2023-06-21 - v2.1.8
 - When backing up driver, the no-autoinstall dkms option wasn't saved. Fixed.
* 2023-07-07 - v2.1.11
 - After upgrade to version 3.92.0, Zenity has changed for GTK4 and doesn't display current theme anymaore (under Gnome, maybe. Mate here). GTK4 is a bit weird with Zenvidia, so choose was made to doesn't display window decoration title. The optional idea to migrate to Yad is open.
 - Zen Notify, was using 'uname -p' to get host type, but it doesn't since distro upgrade (fedora 38 here). Fixed.
 - It appears that zenity new version create a selinux alert through gdb in su mode (maybe a gdb only, mayber fedora only ?). User need to add exception for selinux.
 - zenity width and height have been modified to reflect zenity display change occordingly to zenity distro version.
 - Added a win_warnig fucntion to reflect zenity actual and future changes.
* 2023-07-16 - v2.1.12
 - Fixed missing zenity tags from the previous update issue.
* 2023-07-28 - v2.1.15
 - egrep seems to be out dated in a short time, fixed with grep -E.
 - It appears that NVIDIA device name could severly differ from the system one and a result of a false flag 'incompatible device' (optimus laptop case). This is normaly fixed now.
 - Nut shell found in xorg config for clock detection. it was only counting 2 digit instead 3. Fixed.
 - Makefile for install, update, etc processes wasn't lock to root user and resulted with wrong installation for some files and confuse zenvidia afterward when 'make install' were run again. This is hopefully fixed.
 - Fixed other missing zenity tags.
 - BUG: Zenity continue to do weird thing, it appears it wont display long text in 'text-info' option and close some nvidia help chapters unexpectedly. No clue.
* 2023-07-31 - v2.1.16
 - Zenvidia notify section displayed text and actual set was missing for an unknown reason. Fixed.
 - Zen Notify desktop entry MATE specific delay set was missing. Fixed.
 - NOTE : If your desktop manager is not GNOME or MATE, you have to setup manually displaying delay with your autostart desktop entry manager.
* 2023-08-01 - v2.1.17
 - Makefile current user detection mistake that resulting 'make update' and probably 'install' fails (thanks to my friend for sharing her laptop). Fixed.
 - Updated egrep to grep -E
* 2023-08-08 - v2.1.18
 - Changed the way of Super User detection at makefile process using 'stat' instead of 'pwd' and 'ls'.
 - Modified zen_notify's way for version detection, previous was too strict. Updated 'egrep' to 'grep -E'.
 - Zen Notify wasn't testing if local git repos were present or not. Done.
* 2023-09-02 - v2.1.24
 - It appears that zenity 3.92.0 progress windows simply ... crash in install case (but not only). Ii doesn't break the process, it just disappears. Install process display replaced by Yad for this version.
 - Driver update windown converted to Yad.
 - Driver switch converted to Yad (open/propriatary) with a few fixes.
 - Last check window in driver install process was mistaken in case of install an older driver upon the last one. Hopefully fixed.
 - Nvidia drm modeset driver was improperly set in some case. Fixed.
 - It looks like that nvidia-drm.modeset grub option set to 1 could fix tearing. This accordingly to this article (https://daanberg.net/en/kennisbank/linux-nvidia-tearing-fix/) combine with v_sync enable in nvidia-setting fix that issue. Drm modeset config has been modify to override all default set if basic conf drm_modset=1 is set.
 - It appears that nvidia-settings rc file was not load at session start. 535.104 looks like fixing this issue, but by security we add a autostart desktop file to load the file whatever the situation.
 - Note 1 : (fedora 38 case) zenity has been updated to 3.99. At this point it didn't look to fix anything.
 - Note 2 : nvidia-settings-rc autostart desktop file will install in 'make update' process. If you don't want this or if it creates issue, remove it from HOME/.config/autostart directory.
 - Note 3 : accordingly to the above note, because some applications meet issues with FSAA (like steam, cairo-dock, etc) and desktop session with v_sync, it is needed to set FSAA (antialliasing) and sync to vblank (yes) in nvidia-settings.
 - Because of the Yad migration, many commented codes are not cleaned yet. Il will be gradually in next releases.
* 2023-09-20 - v2.1.33
 - Add a Zenvidia task menu with essential features. Zenvidia and zen_notify patched accordingly (zen_notify launch the taskbar menu script). Menu entries are automatically added when needed (ex: open driver switch).
 - Yad update progress: Many functions have been modified and still under watch. Code is revisited meanwhile. Zenvidia will be upgrade v2.2 after entire Yad migration.
 - Nvidia installer do not take care of /usr/libX/nvidia installation is set. Relink to /usr/libX/nvidia from setted directory was made in post install, but faulty because new version install /usr/libX/nvidia and new content no matter what, causing between other nvidia-settings to not find profiles documentation. This is fixed.
 - The difference between open driver and closed source driver UVM module usage became too complex (open driver use it by default). Choice has been made to install all modules and avoid blacklist on UVM module and DRM molule. Code will be clean in next releases.
 * 2023-09-22 - v2.1.34
 - Urgent fix : mistakes was made on last upload. Some text were paste by error and I didn't notice this, and IFS restoration was misplaced (Yad need many). All this was preventing script to read correctly some internals functions. Hopefuly fixed.
 - Menu were converted meanwhile to Yad, change are still unstable. I will upload fastly if other mistakes are found.
 - I didn't realize I was in a low shape state, that's why all those mistakes. My apologies.
* 2023-09-22 - v2.1.35
 - Second and hopefuly last big migration session for Yad. Yad is not working exactly like Zenity. By some side it is more simple and other more complexe. It will be under watch for a little while.
 - Gui colors editor wasn't redirect correctly upon multi previews loads. Fixed.
 - Enhanced Makefile update command to automaticaly make a backup of zenvidia script and user configs.
 - A few other little bugs and nut shells have been fixed.
 - Next is a extended Xorg configurator/ Until upload Xorg section is still under Zenity.
 - Need to review help tips.
 - Need to review 'Driver upgrade' window result that is still confuse in some specific case.
* 2023-10-27 - v2.2.0
 - Add a new Xorg configuration GUI to check and configure all Xorg options.
 - Add 545 serie specific values for both propriatary and open drivers.
 - Add 545 serie percistenced GPU init service for open drivers.
 - Migrated forgotten Zenity functions to Yad.
 - Specific open source module variable was missing at install time. Fixed.
 - Restore current driver backup over itself is prohibite if libGL is in the current xorg extension dir. libglxserver_nvidia allow this type of overwrite. Backup restore function has been update consequently with a finest lib check.
 - Basic configuration file has been change with remove and additions, please update.
 - Distro config don't need some varialbes anymore and will be clean in next releases.
 - Note : Last 545 beta driver is buggy for Wine games, Open source is better. Use of nvidia percistenced on open source driver helps a little and is automaticaly enabled for it starting with 535 serie. Percistenced on propriatary was not tested.
 - BUG : It appears that some xorg TIPs in Xorg config GUI wont display when zen_notify is load from session start, but perfectly display when either zen_notify or zen_task_menu is start from command line. Tips in debug file are just truncate or are not detect at all. It look lke to be a 'man page' command line issue, but at this point, no clue on how to solve this.
 * 2023-10-30 - v2.2.1
 - Realized that nvidia-setting-rc.desktop wasn't validated in remote git repos. Preventing makefile to install properly. Fixed and sorry ...
* 2023-10-31 - v2.2.2
 - Fixed inapropiate device check for multiple devices that prevent xorg conf gui to display correctly.
 - Replace default envirroment stock icon by dedicated one; depending on theme, icons wasn't really redable for user.
 - Fixed inapropriate zenvidia version update in makefile.
 - It appears that commands launch from zen_task_menu don't return some variable value that are returned from command line and could give errors. Watching this.
 - This time script was check out of the box.
* 2023-11-04 - v2.2.3
 - It appears that YAD_PID used to kill main install window is detect in some desktop environment and not in others (ex here: mate and Xfce). YAD_PID is check to display markup in some function like driver backup or kill app in case of fatal error. Fallen back to from_install variable set. Fixed.
 - In case of a multiple relauch of driver update check, list create during the process wasn't clean correctly resulting in lines displayed in double or more. Fixed.
 - In case of multiple download in the same zenvidia session (official, beta) and then laucnching install process, script was only remind the last dowloaded package as new version to install. Fixed.
 - It appears that "zen-icon" as a name for ex swiss_knife png is already used by an other application. Fixed.
 - Some exit status arround compilation failure were mistaken. This is normaly fixed.
 - When launch from desktop session start, nvidia installation BIN PATH is not set (reason why nvidia bin were not found by sys command -v). Fixed.
* 2023-11-09 - v2.2.4
 - Add an experimental 'session restart only' feature at the end of installation process and open driver switch process. We need to ne CLEAR, this is VERY EXPERIMANTAL and only tested on LIGHTDM service event it could potentialy work on other display manager service.
 - WARNING : Be aware that 535.113.01 open-driver looks to have fatal issue when reloading this ways by loosing udev nvidia devices creation, so don't use this features with this driver open source version.
 - Installing an old version upon a newer one was not enough fine in numeric version comparission resulting in installation fails. Update and fixed.
 - In case of the above failure, exit status was not set properly (again). Hopefuly fixed this time.
* 2023-11-11 - v2.2.5
 - Fast fix : missing null value in numeric driver version detection. This is not fatal for actual driver versions.
 - WARNING : During test on a old laptop with 390 serie, nvidia-installer just remove the compiled driver calling this 'old install'. I clearly forgot this behaviour in nvidia-installer fixed in new version. I need to work on a workaround for 390 serie and earlier (410 until 440 need to be tested aswell).
* 2023-11-16 - v2.2.6
 - Regarding old serie detection, add a filter reversing the install process. This is a this point experimental, max version serie is still not known (too old). Because of this, we may have to maybe consider capturing Zenvidia's capabilities from the 260 series only.
 - Modified filter in install process in case of driver reinstall which wasn't allowed until now.
 - Re-inspect fatal driver or libs log messages to be more better filtered. Still more work to do on this, there is to much alert lines that may confusing.
 - Nut shell in systemctl reload commend line. Not fatal but anoying. Fixed.
 - Multiple install process launch was still diplay multi lines (missing var in a grep line). Just hoping this is fixed now.
 - Note : The driver session reload function has been tested on the 390 series, need more tests out of the box to confirm. In plus of LIGHTDM, GDM, SDDM, LXDM are based on a service file and link to display-manager.service, they will very probably work. KDM is based on a desktop file and is not supported at this point.
 - Regarding the 535.113.01 open-driver issue: This is not clear now that driver reload at session start is in cause. Maybe a driver bug itself.
 - Next : working on xorg config GUI section to manage Optimus options in the idea of preparing PRIME/Offload support.
* 2023-11-27 - v2.2.7
 - xorg config GUI adapted for optimus config needs.
 - Add xz container to backup management. Experimental : GZIP, XZ, depends of the number of processor threads, are selected automaticaly. Auto detect can be bypass in config file to only use GZIP.
 - Reduced usage of distro config at really specifics needs (at this point distro config file is useless at least in fedora).
 - Reordoned a few vars. Some of them were reapeateds uselessly or useless.
 - Restructured backup/restore tools.
 - Fixed nutshell in nv_persistenced function.
* 2023-12-09 - v2.2.8
 - Optimus xorg auto config was set to force only with opti_preset=1 in base conf file. This is now auto detected, opti_preset in conf will overwrite auto detected value if set by user choice.
 - Old device compatibility check was not set properly. Fixed.
 - Edit Script Conf section wasn't exit properly when launch from task bar. Fixed.
 - Edit Xorg Conf section wasn't exit properly when launch from installation process. Hopefuly fixed.
* 2023-12-17 - v2.3.5
 - ATTENTION : This patch include a urgent fix for fresh drivers install and drivers entire removal (read below). It wans't expect to come so soon. All cases usage circonstances are not tested. Using PRIME Display config is not totally safe. Next patch will comme with more controls on old dev's laptop.
 - Add PRIME Display support. ATTENTION HERE this is VERY experimenatal. Lightdm, gdm, sddm are actually support. At this point, PRIME and PRIME render offload are managed, more can be added, like NVIDIA-XRUN for example (dev need feddback for this). PRIME support can be bypass or force in user config file. Added a offload_run script to load needed offload's option for applications.
 - Translation is making its coming back. Script is now set to manage translation sub system.
 - Translation in edit : french (not available yet).
 - Transalation kit for translator can be found in zenvidia git repos 'locale' directory. translation.pot is the ready to go file for translators. (translation.pot is not totaly update because of the urgent fixes, wait for next update to use it)
 - Rewrite menu_modif function to better support new and future changes.
 - Enabled nvidia-powerd daemon for compatible laptop.
 - User basic config has changed. Update as necessary.
 - Initramfs was taking to much time an old laptop or PC devices during install process that making install process to stop unexpectedly. Fixed.
 - Fixed a few nut shells in text and vars.
 - The not glorious mistakes and accidental removing and others :
 - Fixed missing and lost vars in lib elf listing preventing creation for dedicated conf in ld.conf.d and modprobe.d blacklist on fresh install.
 - nvidia-modules-reload rename zenvidia-modules-reload to prevent remove when nvidia driver is removed (nvidia-* wildcard to remove binaries).
 - When Nvidia driver was removed and system back to nouveau, lighdm wont start. In cause, dm-service patched file that wasn't put back to its safe state. Fixed.
 - And a few others dev wont remind.
 - Bug : xorg conf gui doesn't managed display 'screens' in Layout config section, fix with the next patch. Temp files are not remove if the GUI is reload, anoying. try to find the right fix.
 - Other warning : Desktop manager reload system is not made for fresh install with nouveau still in place. It just freeze the TTY. Working on a way to use it, if any or just filter to avoid it.
* 2023-12-21 - v2.3.13
 - PRIME Display configurator tested (more than once, I mean). PRIME setup only tested, no PRIME render offload device available.
 - xorg Layout section 'screen' option management done.
 - xorg GUI config temp file issue fixed.
 - Nouveau driver filter added for driver fresh install case.
 - translation base files done and upload.
 - removed initramfs rebuild from driver removal function. Useless.
 - rewrote zenvidia configuration GUI to better fit PRIME settings needs.
 - PRIME Display function in task bar was still using removed opti_preset set. Moved to xrandr modesetting detection to fix.
 - Zenvidia color GUI manager wasn't display correctly on small screens (720p) and default window close button signal (252) wasn't managed and cause color conf file data to be removed. Fixed.
* 2023-12-23 - v2.3.15
 - wrong quote in basic conf file for PRIME display set. Fixed.
 - zen_task_menu PRIME has been change to modesetting detection to menu display in prevous patch. It wasn't known by the dev that nouveau is also name as modesetting by xrandr. So, PRIME detection has been change to more than one provider and Nvidia as one of them.
 - tested the new nvidia-isntaller 545 serie option '--allow-installation-with-running-driver': nvidia-isntaller still not overwrite existing drivers and abort for both dkms and no-dkms for current kernel. Build and install work for an other kernel, but driver are not compressed and install a brut ko file if no-dkms option. Conclusion : nvidia-installer new feature didn't met hopes and expectation and is still useless for zenvidia.
* 2023-12-24 - v2.3.20
 - Reintroduction of the "delay" option instead of a simple "hold" for log windows. Default delay is 4 secondes.
 - zenvidia config GUI has been update to better filter uncheck value to a default state.
 - remove old 'no_warn' set from basic conf, useless. Change message in conf file.
 - Fix a missing space in grub config for fbdev option in 545 serie.
 - systemctl deamon-reload was not enought in zenvidia-modules-reload and dm-service wont start after driver install/update on sys reboot. Replace by systemctl daemon-reexec whitch seems doing the job better.
* 2023-12-27 - v2.3.25
 - modifed grub function update regex to remove fbdev=1 from grub config (back from 545 serie test), if any.
 - fixed 'update driver' pulsing window message whitch was still displaying markup.
 - updating an already build driver was rebuilding initramfs, useless. Replace by modprobe/selinux modules reload.
 - initrmafs command detection has been rewrite for a better inter distro interpretation.
 - Remove systemctl daemon-reexec/reload from zenvidia-modules-reload, useless. Issue apprently came from script output was empty and systemctl looks to not appriciaite it. Still under watch.
 - fixed nut shells.
 - translation fr_FR made up at 30%.
 - Note : my old 12 years old laptop screen passed away. 'Out of the box' tests should become delicates.
* 2023-12-30 - v2.3.27
 - Yad exit code 252 fixed. It is now same as code exit 1. Filter is still under watch to be sure of the best behaviour.
 - Task bar open driver switch were still display message from script config edit even if set or unset. Wrong ordered old sets variables and temp file were in cause. Fixed.
 - Missing initramfs message in open driver switch. Fixed.
 - translation fr_FR made up at 40%.
 - Note : Fixes are not fatal for the previous patch, but uploaded because they are atleast anoying. It could be a bit been soon, so, some others could appear in between (sic).
* 2023-12-31 - v2.3.29
 - Add grub default config to driver backup to reflect 545 serie fbdev option in line.
 - Add grub re-build in driver backup restoration.
 - Bug : Fixed user config dir priviledges during first script launch on a tester feedback. Thanks to him.
* 2024-01-04 - v2.3.31
 - Add a warning message for xorg config overwrite (install and rewrite case) to preserve user config edits.
 - Old nvidia profile files are now removed at install time.
 - Add a nvidia-application-profiles-rc fixer and copy to user dir. Installed rc file are not readable by nvidia-settings and not usable if there's no ccpy in user nvidia dir or in /etc. Xml trouble reading is maybe my system case only, I can't tell if this is for all, then set is define by fix_profiles=0/1 in basic config.
 - A few minor and text nutshells fixes.
 - Basic conf need to be update (above statement).
* 2024-01-09 - v2.3.32
 - URGENT FIX : big mistake in last fast fix. Lost the fact that distro need to be know before last fixed function. My very bad mistake.
 - Last distro optionnals files uploaded was mistaken (yes...). It was not apprently fatal, just stupid.
* 2024-01-12 - v2.3.33
 - remove problematic 'ditro' config file function and replace all distro files by only one distro.conf file editable by user.
 - if user needs to add some very specifics distro variables, system conf directory (ex. grub), he just have to edit distro.conf file as appropriate. All same for some specifics dependencies for his distro. Afterward relaunch Zenvidia to make the script install those dependencies (help comments inside config file).
 - distro.conf file is very optional, main distros values are auto detected.
 - fixed a wrong exit code value in zen_notif for internet connection detection that prevent notif and task bar message to be displayed.
 - there were issue with default IFS values restoration for yad window lists, yad is very strict with this. Hopefully fixed.
 - translation will come soon, but need a review before upload.
 - ISSUE : zen_notif looks to meet some issue and need to be deeply reviewed.
* 2024-01-14 - v2.3.34
 - Add a basic conf file diff for updates. Script will add new vars automaticaly. It doesn't prevent user to inspect the file :).
 - Makefile has been change to manage default user priviledges for local Zenvidia directory and prepared for locales translation files. Last user dirs access fast fix is still in use and will be remove in near future.
 - In first launch process, modinfo is telling if a module is already present before telling is none. There was to much test whitch slowing the process. It has been shortened for faster execution.
 - In case of distro.conf inspection at launch, test of dep_list presence was not test before read into the file and was returning a warning. Fixed.
 - Fixed a missing a wrong exit codee in Zenvidia change log window.
* 2024-01-16 - v2.3.35
 - Typo error in zen_task_menu at last upload preventing execution of changelogs and nvidia docs reader.
 - The local directory selector window for installation wasn't return the good number of packeges found in local user download directory. Fixed.
 - fr_Fr translation added.
 - Translation note : la traduction en français n'est peut être pas parfaite, des coquilles et erreurs de grammaire sont probablement encore présentes. Soyez aimable de les signaler.
* 2024-01-18 - v2.3.36
 - Add a warning (with exit) in xorg config tools if xorg configuration file is not found.
 - nutshells and markup errors in zenvidia.mo FR translation file. Fixed.
 - workarround dkms function was returning wrongly an error message, fixed.
 - Compilation window exited even if hold option was set. Fixed.
 - missing translation line added.
* 2024-01-24 - v2.3.37
 - The was no test to launch zen_task_menu in case of first use. Until then, the user had restart the session. Added.
 - ABOUT text file missing, don't ask why it was.
 - ABOUT entry added to zen_task_menu.
 - Add missing tip for Prime Display in 'Configuration and tools'.
* 2024-01-27 - v2.3.38
 - xorg config GUI tips were to long to extract and could be problematic for old computers or weak CPU. As a workaround, an x-tips and nv-tips file has been added and stored in the zenvidia doc directory created during driver installation. This considerably reduces execution time.
 - Corrected nutshells in fr_FR translation.
* 2024-01-30 - v2.3.39
 - In version 2.3.27, exit code 252 (action on window close button) was set as same as code exit 1, it was a fast change whitch finaly doesn't match to a good behaviour. Now action on window kill all zenvidia and exit.
 - Makefile wasn't set user rights on autostart desktop files. Done.
 - Add nvidia version detection at first use in case of driver already installed by other mean, then writen in version.txt.
 - Corrected nutshells in translation.pot and fr_FR translation.
* 2024-01-31 - v2.3.40
 - Missing IFS system variable restoration at the end of make_tip_docs whitch making end installation display tabs incorrect and corrupt driver installation (libs install replay only) and force to rebuild drivers. Fixed.
 - Reordering of start-up variables with in mind to optionally adjusting driver installation parameters (not implemented).
* 2024-02-02 - v2.3.41
 - After research about Kdm for driver reload at session restart it appears (I didn't know) that KDM is simply SDDM. So, session restart is technicly usable. Session restart messages is changed accordingly.
 - Fixed a few nutshells.
* 2024-02-06 - v2.3.42
 - In some rare and unknown reason, it look like nvidia-installer or dkms remove installed nvidia kernel modules. Circonstances are really not clear and it cannot be told if it came from nvidia-installer or dkms. So, to prevent the issue, script will restore newly compiled modules previously backed up if they are missing after libraries installation. Issue is under watch and marked unknown.
* 2024-02-11 - v2.3.43
 - Nvidia-installer, no matter what, remove dkms used driver three in case of a libraries reinstall only, sometime in conjonction with installed kernel modules. Because there is cases where libraies reinstall could be necessary (files corruption, accidental lost, etc). at this point, a temporary saved folder will be created to restore dkms three and kernel modules if lost. Note, this is a Nvidia issue, not a dkms one.
* 2024-02-16 - v2.3.44
 - Minor : Modules suffix detection in some function was faulty, replaced by a more simple one.
 - Tracking errors is difficult without feeback. Please consider to send a few.
