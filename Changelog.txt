* 2022-12-26 - v2.0.1
  - In the particular circonstance of a fresh kernel update (happens to me today), only the defined module type is automaticaly compiled at boot time by DKMS daemon (open or prop). This situation wasn't expected by open driver switch tool. Now the tool have acces to recompile section for this particlar case.
  - Distro config section at start didn't take care of sudo unknown type over a known or unknown distro. now the sudo type is ask and saved in the main script conf if not in default known distro list.
  - Add a display manager restart/reenable function when in rescue terminal mode only (bored to type it each time when testing).  Function also reload drivers allowing to emmediatly start the DM. DM is evaluate on systemctl status. If it doesn't work for you, post a thread in discussion with the result of systemctl status [your-dm].
  - Fix a few nutshells in README.md HELP.txt and other. I will probably find more in future.
* 2023-01-03 - v2.0.2
 - Found that "Update driver for an other kernel" was still using old vars and wasn't install driver in the disered kernel path. This is fixed.
 - Found that Display Manager detection was useless if DM service was manually disable. Reworked with a 'known' dm service list (gdm,kdm,xdm,lightdm,lxdm,slim,sddm) then fall back to previous method if not found. If you have a better idea for fallback, be welcome.
 - grub command find method was wrong, fixed.
 - Encapsuled code for xterm process was faulty in many ways. Remove, add/remove wasn't work properly in some condition. This patch try a new process.
 - Dkms has issues when a kernel host a driver he didn't manage and just not remove it even asked for. It happens some times too when updating a driver for an other kernel. This patch is trying to fix this.
 - initramfs is not usefull in all circonstances. This is long and boring process to just fixing open/prop value at kernel boot.
 The issue is that not all install dkms process take over a simple modprobe relaod and initrmafs update is still necessary.
 For this patch, "Update driver for an other kernel" is using it , other install function use modprpobe and systemd-modules-reload service with a fallback to initrmafs update tool if systemed tool is not found.
 - removed driver backup in nvidia's directory. It became useless.
 - reordered shared_var process that only belonged to old script's system.
 - zen_notify was displaying a use le blank line. This is fix (hopefuly).
 - add a reinit command to command line rescue process that only taking care of initramfs and DM service restore.
 - exec_mod_load take care of the installed divice when doing modprobe, could be changed to "all" if reporing issues.
 - nv_cmd_make_src need probably to be reviewed.
 - Else : I need a rest v_v ...
* 2023-01-04 - v2.0.3
 - modprobe modules reload was experimented in last 'push' v2.0.2 for driver upgrade. It definively doesn't work. Initramfs update is now used only until find out a better solution. In case you this issue, just exec 'zenvidia reinit [driver_version]' when locked in terminal at boot.
 - basic conf has been reorder to diplay important sets first and make it more readable.
 - fixed little mistakes.
 - issue : need to get pid when in VT mode and kill it at DM service start because the console is still active and zenvidia doesn't report the right user (root instead of default user).
* 2023-01-05 - v2.0.4
 - Forgot to update 'open driver switch' to new 'version' detection function. Fixed ( Yeah, not my best swing...)
 - Found a way to kill extra root tty when starting from console. Now the pid is auto killed after DM start.
 - Trying to find a way to prevent wrong driver to be compiled at boot time (case mutli versions present in DKMS /var/lib). DKMS seems to like the higher version even if a lower is installed.
* 2023-01-08 - v2.0.5 (with 525.78.01 fix)
 - INCLUDE FAST FIX: Driver version 525.78.01 give error at nvidia-drm driver load with nvidia.drm-modeset=1. This patch look in basic conf for a custom setting of nvidia.drm-modeset to overwrite automation. Read README to how add the custom line in basic file. Or remove local basic conf to get shipped default.
 This was made in emergency, some issues could appears because of the changes below.
 - After research and tests, it appears adding the dedicted DKMS blank file 'no-autoinstall' in /etc/dkms allow to build only the authorized dkms.conf file with 'AUTOINSTALL=yes' to be compile at boot time. This is now how zenvidia works.
 However, the distro package updater (fedora dnf in my case) seems needing the DKMS option 'autoinstall -all' to be set at kernel update, and thus, package install scripts don't compile the driver. This is absolutly not fatal, juste anoying.
 Note that if you have other drivers to be compile at boot time, you need to add in their dkms.conf file the option 'AUTOINSTALL=yes'; if you don't, they just wont compile at a new kernel update.
 - Looking for a way to use initramfs divert tools without put it in distro configuration files. Known tools are : dracut, update-initramfs, mkinitcpio. Script now look up to this tools in the describe order then autoconfig it internaly to exec initramfs reload. If none is found, it ask to proceed with modprobe reload only with a warn about consequencies or abort.
 Because of the fast fix, distro's config files are not update yet.
 - Devs have change something in version changelog text I didn't look into yet that prevent last changes to be read correctly.
* 2023-01-12 - v2.0.6
 - Changelog text file reading is fix (found some mistakes by the way). Hoping my dear lovely trolls wont change something else at next version :).
 - Fixed base menu display that suddently change for an absolutly unknown reason O_o. If you meet Zenity display issues, please tell it in Discussion section.
 - Zen Notify git repos part wasn't report and display correcty needed messages. It's hopefuly fixed. Complete change log can be found in default user zenvidia's directory (.zenvidia/src/zen_git.log).
 - A few moves in script syntax. I keep going deeper into the code until my thought tell me that everything is stable enought.
* 2023-01-15 - v2.0.7
 - zen_notify option command '-z' (driver and zenvidia update notification) wasn't report and fill changelog and notfication correctly (wrong comparative date check). This is fixed ... probably.
 - uploaded admended distro config files.
* 2023-01-17 - v2.0.8
 - add a Zenvidia changes log reader. Useless, therefore obviously a mandatory feature.
 - Trying to find a way to not use initramfs_tools and was partly successful. All update modules tools works fine without rebuilding initramfs, but install and upgrade section still need it. Add an option in basic config file to set/unset use of initramfs that could be usefull in futur and present if user want to use initramfs only for all purpose or issue. Still diging.
 - Changed for a lighter method to discover needed system commands (dkms, lspci, etc).
 - Little review of dep_control function to diplay missing dependencies list instead of just warn.
* 2023-01-21 - v2.0.9
 - Went to last update to fast and didn't test zen_notify enought. I'm not a great git syntax user and it appears that using 'git fetch' on the downloaded zenvidia git repo wasn't a good idea. I wished to add last updated files in zenvidia log, but it's now certain that it couldn't be done with git only. So, only change log is now added (this change log), and put an issue alert if new mistake and so on, pops up... again.
 - Globally, my apologies. Yes, this is not the last...
 - Archive restore DKMS section was wrong and give wrong version number that removed ... the restored nvidia dir at the end u_u. Plus, when DKMS process engage for modules build, old version were wrongly define, then dkms wont installed nothing because the restored version were lower than the already present one. This a dkms limitation. Fixed.
 - For the same reasons, commandline tools has been admended to work in the same way.
 - Add a check sum control and fix a size diff between remote and local downloaded drivers packages, that... didn't diff nothing (old zenvidia bad legacy). Script now control if check sum is possible, but check also if size between downloaded and remote differ in case of download error.
 - initrmafs process is now applied on a mandatory for install/upgrade drivers and for archives restore if dkms is use to build inexistent modules. No alternative found at this moment.
 - There's still some little things I wish to change.
 - I hope this the very last of my mistakes this time v_v. Should I apply for a job at M$ ?
* 2023-01-22 - v2.0.10
 - zen_notify issue with '-z' option (again v_v), previous patch was mistaken. Fixed.
 - read zenvidia changelog was read from zenvidia local dir, this is rubbish. Read now from Changelog.txt.
 - Makefile change accordingly.
* 2023-01-27 - v2.0.11
 - restore backup previous package detection mistake. A variable was misplaced in processus that prevent previous version dir to be removed (not fatal, anoying).
 - restore backup tool was using modprobe reload that seemed to work, but, not really. Fallback to initramfs_tools until figure out something more sure. Use command line reinit tool in case of troubles.
 - Re arranged update section window and behaviour.
 - Secondary driver was always compiling even if already builded. Add a filter to detect if driver is already in DKMS path before building anything.
