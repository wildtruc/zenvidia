 <b>## ZENVIDIA ##</b>
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
This is a bash/zenity script for managing NVIDIAÂ© propriatary drivers.
Actual version pretty name : 2.0

oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
 <b># History</b>
<s>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</s>
I started Zenvidia several years ago in a background of non existent Nvidia drivers managed by distros.
I builded it with a light knowledge of bash code I was learning on the scratch and with the only goal
of my own use.
I finally brought it to the community, with all my knowledge gaps, and maintained it for a couples of years
until my health prevent me to go on.
I throw the sponge, hoping someone somewhere one day will continue or make a new one.

Despite my personal condition I went by time back in the code to add, change some little things because
I was still using it, and despite the fact that my distro was delivering Nvidia drivers,
Zenvidia was still more flexible and cool.

Then, the 515 drivers series went out with the open source drivers. Yeah, it was cool, but as always
Nvidia's old school linux drivers developpers put brut terminal only tools, event not a possibility to test
and switch back.
And as always, I decided to put that in Zenvidia.
Going back to Zenvidia bash code after a so long suspend was not a peace of cake and take me at least 2
month to understand the clean way to make a fast switch and even wash the code of all the useless things.

Now it's done and tested in almost all weirdest way (<i>I do very strange things some time</i>).
The code wont be maintain, just because of me, I just hope people will enjoy using it, because I don't think
there's any equals in the whole linux community.

Note that the script even if it does less than before is doing more.
