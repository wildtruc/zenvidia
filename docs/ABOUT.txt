echo -e $"<b>ZENVIDIA</b> is a bash/zenity script for managing NVIDIAÂ© propriatary drivers.

<b>A brief History</b>
I started <b>Zenvidia</b> several years ago in a background of non existent <i>Nvidia</i> drivers managed by distros.
I builded it with a light knowledge of bash code I was learning on the scratch and with the only goal of my own use.
I finally brought it to the community, with all my knowledge gaps, and maintained it for a couples of years until my health prevent me to go on and I throw the sponge, hoping someone somewhere one day will continue or make a new one.

Despite my personal condition I went by time back in the code to add, change some little things because I was still using it, and despite the fact that my distro was delivering Nvidia drivers, <b>Zenvidia</b> was still more flexible.

Then, the <b>515 drivers</b> series went out with the open source drivers !
Woaw ! So cool ! ... but not really.

Yeah, it was a big step for Nvidia to bring their drivers to a mix of Open Source and GPL. Alas, as always Nvidia's old school linux drivers developpers put brut terminal only tools, event not a possibility to test and switch back.
I don't blame them, rewrite all Nvidia-installer for a fantasque user ideal is simply not possible, too much code in it.
I wasn't at the top on my shape, but as always, I decided to put that in <b>Zenvidia</b>.

<b>A Brief of Consequencies</b>
Going back to Zenvidia bash code after a so long suspend was not a piece of cake and take me at several months to understand the clean way to make a fast switch and even wash the code of all the useless things.

Now it's done and because sometimes my brain could went out with its pols without notice, <i>I'm still doing very strange things sometimes</i> and that's why I couldn't consider the code as really maintained. I can't warant the quality of the service even if I'm bringing more and more features. I'm probably nut.
I just hope that you, guys, will enjoy using my toy, because, as I know, there is still no equals in the whole linux community.
