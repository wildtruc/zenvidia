"<b>ZENVIDIA</b> is a bash/zenity script for managing NVIDIA© propriatary "
"drivers.\n"
"\n"
"<b>A brief History</b>\n"
"I started <b>Zenvidia</b> several years ago in a background of non existent "
"<i>Nvidia</i> drivers managed by distros.\n"
"I builded it with a light knowledge of bash code I was learning on the "
"scratch and with the only goal of my own use.\n"
"I finally brought it to the community, with all my knowledge gaps, and "
"maintained it for a couples of years until my health prevent me to go on and "
"I throw the sponge, hoping someone somewhere one day will continue or make a "
"new one.\n"
"\n"
"Despite my personal condition I went by time back in the code to add, change "
"some little things because I was still using it, and despite the fact that "
"my distro was delivering Nvidia drivers, <b>Zenvidia</b> was still more "
"flexible.\n"
"\n"
"Then, the <b>515 drivers</b> series went out with the open source drivers !\n"
"Woaw ! So cool ! ... but not really.\n"
"\n"
"Yeah, it was a big step for Nvidia to bring their drivers to a mix of Open "
"Source and GPL. Alas, as always Nvidia's old school linux drivers "
"developpers put brut terminal only tools, event not a possibility to test "
"and switch back.\n"
"I don't blame them, rewrite all Nvidia-installer for a fantasque user ideal "
"is simply not possible, too much code in it.\n"
"I wasn't at the top on my shape, but as always, I decided to put that in "
"<b>Zenvidia</b>.\n"
"\n"
"<b>A Brief of Consequencies</b>\n"
"Going back to Zenvidia bash code after a so long suspend was not a piece of "
"cake and take me at several months to understand the clean way to make a "
"fast switch and even wash the code of all the useless things.\n"
"\n"
"Now it's done and because sometimes my brain could went out with its pols "
"without notice, <i>I'm still doing very strange things sometimes</i> and "
"that's why I couldn't consider the code as really maintained. I can't warant "
"the quality of the service even if I'm bringing more and more features. I'm "
"probably nut.\n"
"I just hope that you, guys, will enjoy using my toy, because, as I know, "
"there is still no equals in the whole linux community.\n"
"\n"
"<b>A brief about Features</b>\n"
" * <b>Driver install</b>\n"
"\t- from local stocks or from remote Nvidia server's package.\n"
"\t- from a downloaded package (anywhere in system).\n"
"\t- New and legacy drivers managed.\n"
