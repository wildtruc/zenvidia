 ## CHANGELOG
 - (2019-10-01) v1.1 (46)
  - Bug fix: Wrong window height prevent to display "Install from" menu titles.
 
 - (2019-10-01) v1.0.9 (45 last)
  - Final cleaned code. Script is now entirely dedicated to driver, bumblebee and prime are remouved.
  - This is the last time I dive into it. Take care, people.
  
 - (2019-11-08) v1.0.8 (44)
  - fix: Until 415 series, it was needed to replace nvidia's libwfb.so by system xorg ones. Above version don't need it, because libnvidia-wfb doesn't even exist. Then, a filter has been added. (I know, coming a bit late)
  
 - (2019-10-10) v1.0.7 (43)
  - Preparing script for next 'offload' tech for optimus. Cleaning useless code and starting to remove all referenced 'bumblebee' data (project looks dead).
  - There were a bug in extract_build functiion, extractor didn't find the driver directory for an unknow reason. Rewrote function filters expecting to avoid this.
  - Add common vars for install type function, bumblebeed avoided, there no more reason to separate them.
  - Fixed DKMS building disfunction: nutshell in DKMS conf file building (sic!) and replace nvidia-installer option by script's one.
  - Old commented and all bumblebee code will be cleaned next version.
  - Note: Bumblebee project looks dead, but it's not really sure and old device could still have the use of it. Then, I will keep bumblebee code in backup in case of project resurection.
   
 - (2019-08-20) v1.0.6 (42) - urgent fixes (b) and grub update to blsconfig.
  - on fedora 30 and probably many other distros, grub has moved to blscfg, script needed to be update.
  - made urgent fixes on previous updates (dev brain is not so well :s, sorry...)
  - add some missing dependencies in auto install (diff,patch), control is made at each start now.
  - fixed some miss behaviour in librairies linking.
 
 - (2019-08-12) v1.0.5 (41) - fixes and update.
   - zen_notify doesn't warn about not existant repos in Nvidia ftp (rare, but happens). This is fixed.
   - Has been update in zenvidia for the same reason.
   - Added warning display message for incompatible drivers in drivers download window.
   - fixed remote repos download (for old and new drivers).
   - A few minor fixes.
   - Clean code.
   - Bumblebee and prime setup has to be blocked, no enought data to update them at this point (next).
   
 - (2019-08-01) v1.0.4 (40) - fixes on previous update.
   - zen_notify fixes for notify-send displayed text.
 	 	
 - (2019-07-25) v1.0.3 (39) - zen_notify fixes.
   - Changed git local repo "find" command line option to directory only.
   - reverse functions order for a better notification display.
 
 - (2019-07-21) v1.0.2 (38) - changes and fixes.
   - Add a GCC Mismatch option in the case of an error occur in GCC compilator mismatch between driver compiler and kernel compiler. Rare.
   - DKMS part can abort in Fedora environment, add a driver compilation check before starting workaround and then move .ko file to kernel dir if detected.
   - Implement previous dkms driver total remove when upgrade to new driver version. Seems DKMS have issue with that (Fedora env exception ? Nvidia-installer ?). 
   - Restructured nvidia hardware compatibility list.
   - Fixed "back to main" selector in some window that didn't... send back.
   - Old code syntax are still there and commented at this point. Bumblebee and others are still not upgraded.
   
 - (2019-02-02) v1.0.1 (37) - git commmit fix.
   - I've just realize zenvidia pkexec policy rules was not commit correctly. My apology, it shouldn't happen.
 
 - (2018-11-28) v1.0.1 (36) - change and fixes
   - Message (important): I have severe heals issue and I don't really know if I could still manage my project alive. I will try to continue to fix bugs and Nvidia options updates, but i can't tell about the future. It's strongly recommanded to fork.
   - Issue #1: DKMS is compiling, but not install modules. Not a clue at this point (Fedora? dkms? nvidia?). Anyway, 2nd workaround install drivers after a few fix. Until debug and fianl fix of this issue, in case of a kernel upgrade, it is mandatory to use the 'Update driver for an other kernel' entry from 'update' menu before restart the computer.
   - Issue #2: script remove all /opt dir and place it in nvidia's directory when installing a previous version of the driver. Have no clue yet.
   - fix: There was an issue with compiling driver for an other kernel when dkms failed. Had to add env new kernel variables and control to fix.
   - Add a modules chooser at install time : most driver modules are not required for default usage. For a better user experience, a modules selector has been added in case user doesn't use Cuda or Optumus Prime. Use of blacklist was prefered to nvidia-installer options sets. Cuda config option is depracated. No translation pack update for the moment.
   - Update script to new/removed nvidia_installer options 410 serie (libs part).
   - nvidia-installer driver compil part has been remove, because useless (can't build with modules loaded and nvidia-installer have no workaround option, a quite stupid).
   - Not done: remove commented trash codes, bumblebleed/prime sections controls and tests.
   - as usual: please, report if somehing strange happens.
 
 - (2018-03-15) v1.0pre (35) - Some change before code review. 
   - .sh suffixes are removed.
   - zen_notify modified for better design and check.
   - update.sh reviewed and modified. Still an issue in configs diff, so backup your configs files before update.
   - makefile reviewed to update.sh new design.
   - changed sudo login to polkit policy (multi distro compat).
   - add zen_start to launch zenvidia through polkit. Desktop files modified accordingly.
   - zenvidia: readapt git updater for auto discover git locals repos. This is still in test.

   - It seems that nvidia-installer --modules-only doesn't compil for a first install, but the work arounds does.
